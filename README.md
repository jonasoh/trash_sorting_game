# The Trash Sorting Game
This is a game made for [SciFest](https://www.scifest.se/w/sf/en) which teaches kids about which items should go into the "organic waste" bin, and how well those items are transformed into biogas and plant nutrients. The players are divided into two teams, each taking turns picking cards from the table. The cards are turned upside down. The player turns over two cards, and discusses with their team which of the items would generate the most biogas/best digestate. Each card has a barcode corresponding to a single letter (see `misc/substrates.csv`). The team scans their "team barcode" (numbers 1â€“4) and then the waste card. The bus moves and the flower grows, accordingly. 

Points are in meters of bus travel / kg of nitrogen per kg of waste (wet weight).
